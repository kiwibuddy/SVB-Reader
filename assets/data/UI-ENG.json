For each sphere we have selected 52 key passages, one for every week in the year. This gives us a total of 364 passages. Additionally,  52 “foundational” key passages detail the basic premises of a Biblical Christian Worldview which are relevant for each and every sphere. All told there are 416 unique passages (some are only a verse long; others are more than a chapter in length). All 66 books of the Bible are used in this amazing, comprehensive one-of-a-kind list. Each passage begins with how God seeks to reveal himself through that sphere. Then the key passages highlight the biblical beliefs, values, principles and practices that are appropriate for that sphere. The final six key passages illustrate a biblical example (either positive or negative) in which that sphere overlaps with one of the other six spheres. There’s much to discover, so let the journey begin!",

    "sphereview_intro_INT": "God’s heart – expressed through the commissioning vision of Jesus’ final words on earth – is to see every expression of humanity, both individual and corporate, restored by the Spirit of God through the redemptive message of the Gospel. He wants every person to have the opportunity to be able to experience God’s life and be adopted into the community of the family of God (Mar 16:15). He wants every nation to be able to experience the transformative impact of the kingdom of God in every dimension of its cultural life, shaping every sphere of society (Mat 28:18-20). This is a compelling dream; a dream which calls us to love God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength until it has become an experiential reality here on earth. Until then, we work and pray as he taught us: “your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven” (Mat 6:10 NIV).",
    "sphereview_intro_FOU": "The Foundational 52 key passages are passages that apply to the whole of society. They are 'foundational' because they are the backbone of a biblical worldview that informs all of life.",
    "sphereview_intro_CEL": "(Arts, Entertainment & Sports): God’s purposes for the sphere of celebration is to strengthen hope and build community. Ever since the days of Jubal (Genesis 4:21), artists have used their skills to entertain people and speak to the heart issues of their culture. Biblically, these artistic gifts are often linked with the prophetic ministry. When God’s ideas are embedded in story form, the truth resonates with both heart and mind, maximizing their impact. Stories of God’s work in the past produce courage and strength for the present and hope for the future.",
    "sphereview_intro_COM": "God’s purposes for the sphere of media is the transfer of wisdom and the promotion of healthy relationships. Proverbs is full of pithy axioms which emphasize the power of communication to do good or to do ill. There is great power not only in what is said but in how it is said. Today, with new media technologies emerging one after another, we have more and more capacity to communicate than ever before. But what are we communicating? Is it bringing life or death? Is it enhancing wisdom or promoting folly? We must enter into this arena as followers of Jesus to use every tool available to advance the ways of the kingdom of God.",
    "sphereview_intro_ECO": "(Science & Technology together with Business) God’s purpose for this sphere is to release provision and model stewardship. Science is the motor of this sphere, for it produces the research that makes possible the creation of wealth by inventing new products and services. The sphere moves forward by the distributive capacity of the business enterprise which produces and sells those inventions. When stewarded well, this process of creating and distributing wealth should enhance the life of people and glorify the Creator who inspires innovation.",
    "sphereview_intro_EDU": "God has designed the educational sphere to be a means of discipleship and multiplication. The purpose should be the transformation of the student rather than the mere transaction of knowledge. Godly education should develop Biblical Christians who have Jesus as their model and the Bible as their foundation. This should occur in a family-friendly context, for God has delegated to the family the primary authority and responsibility for the education of their children. Every family on earth should have access to a Christian school for their children.",
    "sphereview_intro_FAM": "God is the one who had the original idea of family. He instituted marriage at the very beginning of creation (Genesis 2:24) as the lifetime commitment between one man and one woman. When the original couple expanded into a family with the birth of their first child we are told that it was “with the Lord’s help” (Genesis 4:1). His purpose for this sphere is that life might be multiplied and that a God-given destiny for every individual may be established. God desires that we engage with families, to serve and strengthen them, to see his purposes restored.",
    "sphereview_intro_GOV": "God has appointed government in order to safeguard justice and create a peaceful society. Rulers should exercise delegated authority in order to serve the citizens whom they govern. The “Law of the King” found in Deuteronomy 17:14- 21 warns those in authority against multiplying that which would lead them into a life-style of authoritarianism, hedonism and materialism. God’s alternative to these three unrighteous value systems is servanthood, purity and generosity. We must seek to end every form of injustice, corruption and greed and establish godly government.",
    "sphereview_intro_REL": "God’s purpose for the sphere of religion is the extension of mercy and the promotion of reconciliation between those who have had relationships broken. This is to occur horizontally between human beings, and vertically between individuals and God. Competing religious worldviews contend for the hearts and minds of men and women everywhere. Without falling into a contentious spirit, we are to enter this marketplace of religious ideas and clearly display why the gospel of Christ is unique. In fact, the gospel is the only means of enduring grace, for it alone makes lasting reconciliation possible through the sacrificial love displayed on the cross."

          "read_aloud_explanation": "The books of the Bible were written to be read aloud. The Bible relates inspirational examples of what happens when the Scriptures are read aloud (Neh 8:1-3). Reading the text aloud allows more of our senses to be engaged in the Bible. Not only do our eyes see the text, but our mouths speak the sounds, and our ears hear the words. The more we engage God’s word with our senses, the more our minds and hearts have an opportunity to take hold of it, because, as Paul said, “faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God” (Romans 10:17). Reading aloud helps us truly hear and embrace in faith the word of God.",

Black displays the words of the narrator. Red displays the words spoken by God. Green is used for the main character(s) in each book. Blue is used to show the words of everyone else – the supporting cast in the biblical narrative.\n\nWe encourage you to gather with a small group of 4 people. Each person chooses one of the 4 colors and together you read the text aloud; each one reading their chosen color.
